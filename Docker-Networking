*****************Networking-Notes*************************
By default when we install the docker , it creates and configure the Host System's docker0 interface as an Ethernet bridge inside the Linux kernel that could be used by the docker containers to communicate with each other and with the outside world.

The docker0 bridge is virtual interface created by docker. All the docker containers will be connected to the docker0 bridge by default, the docker containers connnected to the docker0 bridge could use the iptables NAT rules created by docker to communicate with the outside world.


# yum install bridge-utils
you could use brctl show docker0 to verify if the docker container connects to the docker0 bridge correctly, here is an example:
#brctl show docker0

Tables

   -> FILTER processing of packets
   -> NAT : rewrite the source and/or destination of packets and/or track connection
    -> MANGle : is used to otherwise modify packets, i.e. modifying various portions of a TCP header, etc.


FILTER: Input, Output, Forward
NAT: Prerouting, Postrouting, Output
MANGLE: Prerouting, Postrouting, Input, Output, Forward


    PREROUTING: Immediately after being received by an interface. | Incoming 
POSTROUTING: Right before leaving an interface. | Outgoing 
INPUT: Right before being handed to a local process.
OUTPUT: Right after being created by a local process.
FORWARD: For any packets coming in one interface and leaving out another.
