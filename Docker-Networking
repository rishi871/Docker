*****************Networking-Notes*************************
By default when we install the docker , it creates and configure the Host System's docker0 interface as an Ethernet bridge inside the Linux kernel that could be used by the docker containers to communicate with each other and with the outside world.

The docker0 bridge is virtual interface created by docker. All the docker containers will be connected to the docker0 bridge by default, the docker containers connnected to the docker0 bridge could use the iptables NAT rules created by docker to communicate with the outside world.


# yum install bridge-utils
you could use brctl show docker0 to verify if the docker container connects to the docker0 bridge correctly, here is an example:


#brctl show docker0
